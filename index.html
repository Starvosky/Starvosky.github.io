  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>I'm hosted with Github pages!</p>
  <p>This is more code</p>
  <p>A little more code because I need to merge this branch into the master to prove I'm a big college smart boy.
    <hr>
    <p>Boy do I love hr tags. Magnificence.
      <p>Another one. Another one. Another one. Another one.</p>
      <p> now I'm going to type without looking at the keyboard I've gotten pretty good at it over the years. Not actually practicing it but rather though just memorizing the keyboard layout.
